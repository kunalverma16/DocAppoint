<p>
We belong to an era where we have been blessed by technology in every sphere of life to make life more effective and comfortable.</p>

<p>Unfortunately while technology has penetrated each and every field of health and medicine, few of us know about the latest strides in technology that dentistry has to offer. The good news is that we’ve come a long way! Dentists now have the power to give you a gorgeous confident smile that can bedazzle everyone around you.</p>

<p>Whatever it is that has affected your smile negatively, be it trauma, dental diseases or just bad hygiene or nutrition, has probably impacted the health of your tooth enamel and possibly killed your confidence and your ability to smile as well!</p>

<p>But fret not, Smile Essentials has it all covered for you.</p>

<p>Let’s delve into the details and discuss the various treatments so as to give you a clear idea about the process of getting the perfect smile reconstructed for you.</p>

<p>What are Pain-free Dental Innovations?<br>
Pain-free Dental Innovations are often described as technologies used these days to treat dental health problems without the unnecessary torture that we earlier endured in the name of dentistry. Now these, innovations are useful in two great ways.</p>

<p>First, they offer effective ways to minimize if not completely eliminate the dangers to your gums and teeth.
Secondly, they aim at providing you extreme comfort whenever you undergo any type of dental treatment.</p><br>
Did You Know?
<p>In the past, the treatment of root canals and cavities was among the most dreaded dental procedures due to the pain and discomfort involved.

Patients would often fear getting a cavity or root canal treatment as they could not tolerate the excruciating pain experienced during these dental treatments.</p>


<p>The good news now is that all of this has changed, and you would be thrilled to know that you can reinvent your smile with pain free dental innovations.</p>

<p>What Makes this Technology Unique?<br>
Pain-free dental technology involves the usage of a dental laser to replace the painful needles and drills that were previously used when carrying out dental surgery. This is the most effective and painless way of reinventing your smile-whether you have any cavities, gum diseases or even tooth removal. The best part about this approach is the fact that the patient also heals faster.</p>


<p>Gum Disease Treatment-Surgery??<br>
EARLIER : Periodontitis is the major cause of tooth loss in adults, and the only treatment that works for gum disease usually involves surgically treating or cleaning the gums-involving not only injections but also blades and stitches. With the advent of a variety of pain-free dental innovations, this treatment no longer required painful needles, blades or even stitches.</p>

<p>NOW: The entire procedure can be carried out non invasively by a straight flash of laser light used to treat infections which a blade cannot access without cutting open the gum. Even painful swellings or tumors can be removed with laser surgery.</p>

<p>Advantages to the patient are not just limited to during the procedure but even after since healing is faster, bleeding is negligible, and there is no swelling or pain which would hamper daily activities.</p>

<p>Root Canal Therapy
NOW: Root canal treatment has also become less painful with the use of multiple pain free innovations. We now use the dental laser to remove decay.
EARLIER: The earlier painful needles have been replaced by a sophisticated rotary technology.  These equipments are not only pain-relieving but also enable the entire procedure to be executed within a stipulated time frame which would otherwise take multiple painful sessions.</p>
